## Architecure

This project is based on a medallion architecture which commonly used in data projects

![architecture](./docs/assets/architecture.png)

All of the components of this architecture have been named, most of them based on the greek mithology:

- **Poseidon**: Storage engine used for staging data assets in its raw format before landing into a raw layer. It is based on local temporary storage and GCS for local and development environments respectively.
- **Athena**: Warehouse engine used for storing data assets as tables, composes our medallion architecture by including raw, staging and serving layers. It is based on DuckDB and BigQuery for local and development environments respectively.
- **Optimus**: Transformation engine used for manipulating the data assets and building our models while applying tests to the final datasets. It is based on dbt on all environments
- **Aphrodite**: Data quality engine used for analyzing the final result of our datasets and validate that it complies with common standards. It is based on Soda on all environments.
- **Hermes**: Orchestration engine used for communicating all of the components and data sources. It is based on Dagster on all environments.
